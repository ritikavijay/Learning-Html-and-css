# Learning-Html-and-css

To see the web page developed by me copy the html code in index.html in a notebook and save it with a .html extension.
similarlly the style sheet meant to style your web page is available as style.css ,so copy it in another notebook file with.css extension.
Now create a folder holding both these files.
Run your index.html available in the folder.The browser is going to render this html file.
